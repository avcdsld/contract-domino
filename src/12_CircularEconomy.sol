-------------------------------------------

Waste is a resource in the wrong place.  
We commit to advancing a circular economy for a sustainable future.

Principles:
1. Promote recycling, reuse, and reduction of waste.
2. Support innovation in sustainable product design and materials.
3. Foster systems that minimize resource extraction.
4. Build partnerships to close the loop in resource use.

Together, we will transform waste into opportunity and protect our planet.
